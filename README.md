# nueva_rcv
Ranked Choice Voting script for Google Forms CSV.

To use this, pyrankvote needs to be installed:

```
pip install pyrankvote
```
or, if that doesn't work:
```
pip3 install pyrankvote
```

After that, one can simply run the script without arguments, and it will output election results for all the CSVs in the script's directory:

```
python /path/to/process_results.py
```
or
```
python3 /path/to/process_results.py
```
